# Next + TS + Tailwind

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React is an excellent tool for building front-end applications. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture that developers can follow, it often leads to a messy, inconsistent, and over-complicated codebase.

This repo attempts to present a way of creating React applications using some of the best tools in the ecosystem with a good project structure that scales very well. Based on my vast experience working with different codebases, this architecture turns out to be the most effective.

## Why NextJs

Next.js is an open-source framework built on Node.js that allows you to create React applications that you can render on the server. It provides out-of-the-box tooling and configuration you need to build fast, SEO-friendly React apps.

Whether you want to create static pages, e-commerce applications, or fetch data from APIs, Next.js can help. It enables you to go from one line of code to a full-blown application with little configuration.

This is the main advantage of Next.js. Once you install it, you can start creating fast production-ready applications.

## Why Tailwind

What Tailwind does is it offers more control over styling to the developers. This not only improves development speed but also improves productivity.

A major advantage of Tailwind CSS is that optimization can be performed using PurgeCSS. PurgeCSS can reduce the file size considerably by scanning the HTML and removing unused classes.
